This GitHub repository contains supplementary material and the final product of my senior sociology thesis. Please contact me before using or citing any work that appears here.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Code will be updated and documented as I have time. I am also in the process of cleaning up some of the code before I upload it. Keep checking back!
